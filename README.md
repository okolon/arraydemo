# arraydemo

!!PRESS SPACE ONCE TAKEN TO THE DEMOS (BOTH ARRAY AND LINKEDLIST). MY ADD AND REMOVE BUTTONS DON'T SHOW!!
A program meant to demonstrate the difference between linkedlists and Arrays. 

It's a simple java project but the main takeaways from it were me being able to explain the differences in two seperate data structures but also
to comfortable integrate GUIs into my code which I hadn't done previously.
